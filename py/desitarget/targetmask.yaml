#- THESE BIT DEFINITIONS WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY CHANGE
#- After some initial development experimentation we will freeze the bit
#- definitions, but we should expect this version (Nov 2015) to change.

#- Target type
#- See "obsconditions" definitions below for interpreting mask of what
#- observing conditions are allowable for each target bit
targetmask:
    #------ Dark Time Survey: Bits 0-31
    - [LRG,         0, "LRG", {obsconditions: DARK}]

    - [BGS_KNOWN_BOSS,      42, "BGS known BOSS targets", {obsconditions: BRIGHT}]
    
    #------ Milky Way Survey placeholder: bits 48-59

    - [ANCILLARY_ANY,       62, "Any ancillary bit is set", {obsconditions: DARK|GRAY|BRIGHT|POOR|TWILIGHT12|TWILIGHT18}]

#- Observing conditions
#- These are a bitmask to allow target bits to specify multiple conditions
#- in which they are allowed to be observed.
#- See DESI-0311 and DESI-0333 for discussion of DARK vs. GRAY
obsconditions:
    - [DARK,        0, "Moon is down"]
    - [GRAY,        1, "Moon up; illum fraction<0.6 and (illum*elev)<30 deg"]
    - [BRIGHT,      2, "Moon up and bright (not GRAY)"]
    - [POOR,        3, "Very bad seeing, high extinction, or bright cloud cover"]
    - [TWILIGHT12,  4, "Between sunset/sunrise and 12 degree twilight"]
    - [TWILIGHT18,  5, "Between 12 and 18 degree twilight"]
    - [DAY,         6, "Daytime calibrations"]
    - [CLOSED,      7, "Nighttime but dome is closed due to rain, wind, dew..."]
    - [APOCALYPSE,  8, "Conditions are so bad that the world is ending anyway"]    

#- Possible processing states that a target could be in
#- This isn't really a bitmask since a target can be on only one state, but
#- it can be a useful enumeration
targetstate:
    - [UNOBS, 0, "unobserved"]
    - [OBS,   1, "observed but no spectro pipeline answer yet"]
    - [ZWARN, 2, "uncertain redshift (ZWARN flag set)"]
    - [ZBAD,  3, "confident redshift but it wasn't what we wanted"]
    - [DONE,  4, "confident redshift and no more obs needed"]
    - [MORE,  5, "confident redshift and want more obs (e.g. LyA)"]

#- Priorities for each target bit
#- Numerically larger priorities are higher priority to be observed first.
#- NOTE: these aren't a bitmask, they are a mapping from bit -> priority
#- SAME_AS_XXX means to use the priorities for bitname XXX
#- -1 means the concept of priority doesn't really apply to this target class
#- Every target bit must define priority for "unobs"
#- Default priority for "more" is same as "unobs"
#- Other states are default 0 unless specified here
#- -1 means that the concept of priority doesn't apply to this bit
priorities:
    #- Dark Survey: priorities 3000 - 3999
    ELG: {unobs: 3000}
    LRG: {unobs: 3200}
    QSO: {unobs: 3400, more: 3500}  #- 'more' used for LyA, with higher priority
    LRG_NORTH: SAME_AS_LRG
    ELG_NORTH: SAME_AS_ELG
    QSO_NORTH: SAME_AS_QSO
    LRG_SOUTH: SAME_AS_LRG
    ELG_SOUTH: SAME_AS_ELG
