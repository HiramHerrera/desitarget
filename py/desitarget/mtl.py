    """Adds NUMOBS, PRIORITY, and OBSCONDITIONS columns to a targets table.

    Parameters
    ----------
    targets : :class:`~numpy.array` or `~astropy.table.Table`
        A numpy rec array or astropy Table with at least the columns
        ``TARGETID``, ``DESI_TARGET``, ``NUMOBS_INIT``, ``PRIORITY_INIT``.
        or the corresponding columns for SV or commissioning.
    obscon : :class:`str`
        A combination of strings that are in the desitarget bitmask yaml
        file (specifically in `desitarget.targetmask.obsconditions`), e.g.
        "DARK|GRAY". Governs the behavior of how priorities are set based
        on "obsconditions" in the desitarget bitmask yaml file.
    zcat : :class:`~astropy.table.Table`, optional
        Redshift catalog table with columns ``TARGETID``, ``NUMOBS``, ``Z``,
        ``ZWARN``.
    trim : :class:`bool`, optional
        If ``True`` (default), don't include targets that don't need
        any more observations.  If ``False``, include every input target.
    scnd : :class:`~numpy.array`, `~astropy.table.Table`, optional
        A set of secondary targets associated with the `targets`. As with
        the `target` must include at least ``TARGETID``, ``NUMOBS_INIT``,
        ``PRIORITY_INIT`` or the corresponding SV columns.
        The secondary targets will be padded to have the same columns
        as the targets, and concatenated with them.

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`~astropy.table.Table`
        MTL Table with targets columns plus:

        * NUMOBS_MORE    - number of additional observations requested
        * PRIORITY       - target priority (larger number = higher priority)
        * OBSCONDITIONS  - replaces old GRAYLAYER
