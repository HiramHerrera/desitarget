#- Observation State
#- if a target passes more than one target bit, it is possible that one bit
#- will consider the observations "DONE" while another bit will want "MORE".
#- DONOTOBSERVE trumps MORE which trumps DONE
#- ADM It's possible that we'll want different obsmask criteria compared
#- ADM to the obsmask in targetmask.yaml for the main survey
#- ADM (but it's unlikely we'll want different *obsconditions* or *targetids*

#- Priorities for each target bit
#- Numerically larger priorities are higher priority to be observed first.
#- NOTE: these aren't a bitmask, they are a mapping from bit -> priority
#- SAME_AS_XXX means to use the priorities for bitname XXX
#- -1 means the concept of priority doesn't really apply to this target class
#- Every target bit must define priority for "UNOBS"
#- Default priority for "MORE_ZGOOD" is same as "UNOBS"
#- Other states are default 1 unless specified here
#- -1 means that the concept of priority doesn't apply to this bit
